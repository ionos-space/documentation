# Webinar: The comeback of the static web 

## What is it about?

Our Product Owner Robert gave a keynote at the Digital Bash - Agency Special. He explains why traditional CMS conquered the web since the early 2000s and which disadvantages their usage means from a technical and commercial perspective. Learn why static sites can solve a lot of these issues and why the Jamstack is a meaningful update to the static world. Switching to the Jamstack yields many advantages, not only during the development, but along an entire project lifecycle.
