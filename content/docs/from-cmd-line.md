# From command line

You don't have a specific project at hand but want to start from scratch? Below you can find instruction how to set up projects with popular frameworks starting from the command line.

*Not what you are looking for? [Start from a sample](/docs/framework-samples/) or [deploy an existing repository](/docs/from-repo/).*

## Plain html site

> The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

1. Create a simple plain html site

```
mkdir html-site
cd html-site
echo '<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<h1>Hello World!</h1>\n\t</body>\n</html>' > index.html
echo "file://`pwd`/index.html"
```

2. Visit your site locally by copying stdout to your favorite browser bar.

3. Now, [create a new Git repository on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo#create-a-repository) and copy the URI of the repo to your clipboard.

Afterwards initialize git and push your project to the created GitHub repository by the following commands.

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/reponame.git # replace by URI of your repo
git push -u origin main
```

4. Setup deployment

Sign in to your [Deploy Now](https://ionos.space/) account and click ```New project```. Next, choose the source you want to deploy from. If you created a new GitHub repository you've probably to grant new permission rights to Deploy Now in GitHub. Otherwise it won't be listed right away if you choose ```Deploy from my own GitHub repository```. After selecting your repository choose following configuration.

![Select configuration](/wizard-plain-html.png)

Now, take a short break until your project is build and deployed. Deploy Now will always show you the current build & deploy status of your project. If it's done Deploy Now provides a direct URL to your project. Besides you find in your repository a new workflow file named ```.github/workflows/deploy-now.yaml```.

## Single Page Applications (SPA)

A single-page application (SPA) interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of reloading the entire page for every request.

:::note

:::note
Currently, Deploy Now doesn't support image optimization available in Next.js >= 10, so that you have to edit the `index.js` file to remove this feature.
:::

```import Image from 'next/image'```

Next, locate the following Image tag:

```<Image src="/vercel.svg" alt="Vercel Logo" width={72} height={16} />```

... and replace the Image tag with the standard HTML `img` tag accordingly:

```<img src="/vercel.svg" alt="Vercel Logo" width={72} height={16} />```

Next, edit the `package.json` file and add the `export` option for prerendering all pages to HTML:

```
"scripts": {
    ...
    "export": "next build && next export"
},
```

At last, adapt `.eslintrc.json` to overcome Next.js eslint rules restrictions:

```
{
  "extends": ["next", "next/core-web-vitals"],
  "rules": {
    "@next/next/no-img-element": "off"
  }
}
```
